                <h3>There are many agents involved in a wedding from the photographers and venues to the jewelers and even DJs. Then there is trying to organize everything for the big day like where the ceremony will be held, where each guests will sit, where to register the wedding, etc. Since 2007, Wedding Mapper has been bringing all of these agents to one platform for newlyweds across the world. Users can use the platform to share photos of their wedding, map the list of locations (venue, hotel, airport, etc.), create seating charts & custom wedding webpage and speak to other newlyweds in the message boards. My job was to revamp the users’ experience on Wedding Mapper by redesigning the interface and creating prototypes for Wedding Mapper's tools.</h3>

            <h3>Prior to the wedding day, couples are looking for many things that include where to hold the ceremony and venue, where to get the wedding dress, flowers, or who will shoot the wedding photography. Wedding Mapper already has local vendors setup for users to see their reviews and make a decision. The problem though was actually getting to the user’s city. It’s sometimes nice to make suggestions for the user but it better to let the user have control of the experience. Before the redesign, by default the user would see, among many things, information on San Francisco even if the user was not located there. To fix this, I added a city input field that would be the first thing the user would see landing on the homepage. It would then immediately redirect the user to their local vendors.</h3>

            <h3>Wedding Mapper also gives their users a free website that allows people to know more details about the wedding. This feature is great for letting people know where their registry is, a page RSVP and Guest List to let the couple know who is coming, and about the couple and how they met; tt’s totally up to the couple how many pages they can add to their website. The tool was straightforward, you pick a website template and add photos and text where needed. Before the redesign, there were 160 templates to choose from, which is a lot and the folks at Weebly, Wix, SquareSpace, and WordPress have came a long way since 2007. So I wanted to limit the amount of templates to about 12 and bring in quality options.</h3>

            <h3>During the wedding, it’s important that both the couple and the guest use the wedding map so that everyone is aware of where to go and what time to arrive. How many times have you been in a situation where you needed to get hold of the bride or groom because you needed directions or other information? Rather than bugging the bride and groom on their big day, the wedding map provides instructions and location information for guests and who to contact for additional assistance. I went with a Google Map API interface and redesigned the icons and menu to make it mobile-friendly for the guest on the go. </h3>
